# Figma Plugin: Flatten Within

⬇️ [Download on Figma Community](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1479434711868126998)

A simple plugin that flattens all vector shapes (such as rectangles, ellipses, lines, and paths) within each selected frame or group into a single vector layer. Each frame or group is processed individually, so layers aren’t merged throughout. It’s a quick way to clean up icons or illustrations and make overrides easier when turning them into components.

Created with the help of AI.

## How to use the plugin

1. Select one or more frames or groups that contain vector layers.
2. Run the plugin.
3. Each frame or group will now contain a single vector layer named **Vector**.
